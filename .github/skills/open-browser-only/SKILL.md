# OpenBrowser-only execution policy

Use this skill whenever the task involves browsing pages, extracting page content, clicking forms, or completing web workflows.

## Hard constraints

1. Use only OpenBrowser surfaces:
   - `browser_*` tools from `ai-agent/open-browser` when available.
   - or `open-browser` CLI commands (`navigate`, `interact`, `repl`, `serve`, `tab`, `map`).
2. Do not use Playwright, Puppeteer, Selenium, Cypress, raw Chromium scripts, or alternative browser stacks.
3. Treat OpenBrowser as semantic-first: plan from semantic tree/state and element IDs, never from pixel coordinates.

## Preferred runtime mode

For multi-step tasks, keep one persistent browser session:

- Prefer `browser_new -> browser_navigate -> ... -> browser_close` when browser tools are available.
- Otherwise use `open-browser repl --format llm` (or `open-browser serve` for CDP clients).

Avoid long workflows with repeated one-shot `open-browser interact <url> ...` calls, because each CLI invocation starts fresh state.

## Canonical stateful workflow

1. Open/create session.
2. Navigate to target URL.
3. Read semantic state (`browser_get_state` or equivalent page output).
4. Choose action target by current element ID and intent.
5. Execute one action (`click`, `type/fill`, `select`, `submit`, `scroll`, `wait`).
6. Re-read state after every mutation or navigation.
7. Repeat until success criteria are met.
8. Close the session.

## ID-first interaction policy

- Prefer element-ID operations (`click-id`, `type-id`, `browser_click`, `browser_fill`) over brittle text-only guesses.
- IDs are ephemeral across navigation and DOM updates; refresh state before each follow-up action.
- If a flow opens a new tab/window, switch context explicitly (`browser_tab_switch` or `open-browser tab`).

## Dynamic pages and timing

- Use explicit waits (`browser_wait`, `wait`, or CLI `--wait-ms`) after async actions.
- Enable JS mode when required by the site (`--js` for CLI flows).
- On stale/invalid element failures, re-read state and re-plan from new IDs instead of blind retries.

## Output defaults

- Prefer concise LLM-oriented output (`--format llm`), or JSON when structured extraction is required.
- For extracted answers, include source context (URL and relevant section/text).

## Safety and policy boundaries

- Respect URL policy restrictions (private/loopback/link-local/metadata endpoints can be blocked).
- Respect sandbox and upload limits from project defaults.
- If policy blocks a request, report the constraint explicitly; do not bypass with another browser stack.

## Known capability boundaries

- `Page.printToPDF` is unsupported in semantic-only mode.
- Screenshot support requires the optional `screenshot` build feature; assume unavailable unless confirmed.
- Prefer implemented Open-domain primitives (`semanticTree`, `interact`, `getActionPlan`, `autoFill`, `getCoverage`, `wait`). If a higher-level tool returns `method not found`, fall back to supported primitives.

## Quick CLI examples

```bash
# Single-page semantic read
open-browser navigate "https://example.com" --format llm

# Single interaction from a URL
open-browser interact "https://example.com/login" click-id 7 --format llm

# Stateful multi-step flow
open-browser repl --format llm
```
